# Next Event 
**Thursday December 19th 2019** ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„  
7:00 - 10:00 @ The Art Bank, Shepton Mallet*

Calling local software developers, tech managers, digital enthusiasts, and anyone else who might be interested.
No agenda, just come on down, meet, be merry, and talk about stuff.

*_[The Art Bank](art-bank-map) has a sea shanty gig that day, but music doesn't start till 8:00 so we can either stick around or head elsewhere in town. So please try and arrive by 8:00 if you are planning to come along._
