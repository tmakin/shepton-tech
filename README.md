# Next Event 
Thursday December 19th 2019 ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„  
7:00 - 10:00 @ Shepton Mallet, Venue TBC*

Calling local software developers, tech managers, digital enthusiasts, and anyone else who might be interested.
No agenda, just come on down, meet, be merry, and talk about stuff.

Our usual art bank venue has a gig that day, so we might need to head somewhere else in Shepton. Please check back here nearer the time.
